## Things I would like help with

- Escaping this rabbit hole.
- Optimizing the regexes used for the text replacement
- Helping the extension work with edge cases on popular sites
- Japanese language capability, but somehow, I am sure that something similar already exists
- Bringing in pekofy's logic to enhance the chaos.

## Things I am aware of

- Its not possible to escape.
- This is a low effort copy of millennials-to-snake-people.
